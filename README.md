# Hilt WorkManager Sample
Sample app to show implementation of Work Manager with Hilt in a multi modular project trying to follow the [hilt workmanager documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack)

You can test the implementation by  `git clone git@github.com:oas004/hilt-workmanager-sample.git` and running the project. Press the button on the screen to start the work manager 
process. The process is just to write out in the log, but you can easily change it out with any other hilt provided dependency.
